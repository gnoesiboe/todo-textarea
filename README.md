# Todo textarea

This repository contains a todo app living in the browser, that stores its state in the URL. As a user, you type inside a textarea. The contents is parsed and rendered behind the textarea. The textarea contents itself is hidden. This gives the feeling of writing formatted text, but the freedom of the textarea remains.

For each primary level todo you can also start and stop timers.
